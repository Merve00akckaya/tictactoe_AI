## üìú Game Rules

Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

---

## ü§ñ AI Logic

The AI in this game uses a combination of strategies to make its moves. It employs the Minimax algorithm, which evaluates possible moves and chooses the one that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the player's chances. This ensures a challenging experience for players of all skill levels.

### Key Features of the AI:

- **Defensive Moves:** The AI will block the player if they are about to win.
- **Offensive Moves:** The AI will prioritize moves that lead to a win.
- **Randomized Responses:** To keep the game interesting, the AI may make random moves when there are multiple options.
